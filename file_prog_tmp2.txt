Pune was part of the Jagir (fiefdom) granted to Maloji Bhosale in 1599 for his services to the Nizamshahi (Ahmadnagar Sultanate).
Pune was ruled by the Ahmadnagar Sultanate until it was annexed by the Mughals in the 17th century. 
Maloji Bhosale's grandson, Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Empire, was born at Shivneri, a fort not far from Pune.
Pune changed hands several times between the Mughals and the Marathas in the period 1660 to 1705.
After the destruction of the town in raids by the Adil Shahi dynasty in 1630 and again between 1636 and 1647, Dadoji Konddeo, the successor to Dhadphale, oversaw the reconstruction of the town.
He stabilised the revenue collection and administrative systems of the areas around Pune and the neighbouring Maval region. 
He also developed effective methods to manage disputes and to enforce law and order.
